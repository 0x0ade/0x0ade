The FNADroid Player boots FNA-powered games - even those hackported using XnaToFna.
It doesn't perform any special magic to make your game run on Android (especially regarding its horrible filesystem), which is why your games must be placed at `/sdcard/Android/data/FNADroid.Player/files/`

It requires an Android device running Android 5.0+ capable of OpenGL ES 3.0. Even then, your mileage may vary, as Android GPU drivers are known to be horrible.

At the moment, it also requires you to ship your own controller. I've only tested this using my knock-off wireless X360 controller using an USB On-The-Go adapter, but any Bluetooth controller that maps all X360 buttons should work just fine.
