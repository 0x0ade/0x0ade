Last update for the year:

Fusion Genesis boots into the main menu, MojoShader can translate very simple Xenos pixel shaders (no vertex shaders due to unexpected roadblocks), still lacking almost all opcodes.  
Game keeps crashing for various reasons, both effect- and GamerServices/XDK-related.

Happy New Year!
