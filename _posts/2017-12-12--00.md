Good news:

- "Fusion Genesis" depends on Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Xdk. XnaToFna now contains a few stubs for what the game expects to exist, making "Fusion Genesis" and other future games (more directed towards XBLA titles than XBLIG titles) bootable.
- XnaToFna now also relinks all Type.GetField calls to itself, allowing it to return any fake fields. At the moment, it only returns a fake field when a game tries to access StringBuilder.m_StringValue, instead using ToString() on get and Clear().Append() on set.
- In the .NET Compact Framework, the System.Net namespace is contained in a separate System.Net.dll. On the other hand, the "standard" .NET Framework contains it in System.dll.
XnaToFna now relinks all references from System.Net.dll to System.dll.

Bad news:

XNA 4.0 effects compiled for the Xbox 360 don't work. That's nothing new in itself, but the games I tested until now didn't rely on them.  
This changes with Fusion Genesis, though.

Two options on my mind right now:

- XnaToFna will need to transform the effects using xenia's shader playground, similarly to how it already transforms media using ffmpeg. 
- I'll need to patch X360 effect support into MojoShader. Hesitant about that one because I'll need to learn a lot more, but hey, I'll learn a lot more!
At the moment, I don't have any preference regarding what option to pick, so please let me know which way you'd want me to go.

# [Edit]
Thanks to Merlijn Sebrechts' feedback on Patreon ([check comments](https://www.patreon.com/posts/fusion-genesis-15851820)), I went with forking and patching MojoShader: [https://github.com/0x0ade/MojoShader/](https://github.com/0x0ade/MojoShader/)
