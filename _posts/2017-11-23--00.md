In case you haven't noticed: I took a short break from [MonoMod](https://github.com/0x0ade/MonoMod) and [XnaToFna](https://github.com/0x0ade/XnaToFna), and spent my time improving [Rotonde](https://github.com/Rotonde/rotonde-client) instead. <!-- MORE --> I'm unable to find the source of the memory corruption in MonoMod's runtime detourer - any attempt at debugging it has become a time sink, but more on that later.


[Rotonde](https://github.com/Rotonde/rotonde-client) is a P2P social network initiated by [Devine Lu Linvega (@neauoire / aliceffekt)](https://twitter.com/neauoire), built on top of the ["dat" protocol](https://datproject.org/) and currently living mostly inside of [Beaker](https://beakerbrowser.com/), a Chromium(-Electron)-based "dat" browser. Think "Twitter powered by the users," like Mastodon, but everyone hosting their own instance instead.

It's still very early in its lifetime and has got a long way to go, but I'm personally already amazed by it and how quickly it's moving forward.

I've contributed the following bits and pieces:
- Fixed XSS vulnerability: [#99](https://github.com/Rotonde/rotonde-client/pull/99)
- Pagination, inline images (custom emotes), portal (user) discovery: [#06](https://github.com/Rotonde/rotonde-client/pull/106)
- Fix alias URL - related bugs (support both domain names and full "hash" URLs): [#13](https://github.com/Rotonde/rotonde-client/pull/113), [#24](https://github.com/Rotonde/rotonde-client/pull/124)
- Whispers tab (just required setting up a new tab with a new filter): [#18](https://github.com/Rotonde/rotonde-client/pull/118)
- Move runes to CSS classes, variables and ::after pseudo class: [#26](https://github.com/Rotonde/rotonde-client/pull/126)
- Work around a bug in Beaker where timeouts aren't handled properly: [#29](https://github.com/Rotonde/rotonde-client/pull/129)
- Fixed neglected code related to auto-updates: [#34](https://github.com/Rotonde/rotonde-client/pull/134)
- Improve reconnecting experience by sorting portals list by activity: [#36](https://github.com/Rotonde/rotonde-client/pull/136)
- Go through the entirety of the Rotonde source code, profile and optimize it. Connecting to >100 portals went from a ~30s jittery roller coaster ride to a butter-smooth experience: [#148](https://github.com/Rotonde/rotonde-client/pull/148)  
  This GIF wasn't sped up:  
  ![GIF of fast loading times]({{ media }}/load-fast.gif)
- Add a "big picture" mode for entries with media. Right now, clicking on an image enlarges it: [#150](https://github.com/Rotonde/rotonde-client/pull/150)
- Basic "service message" functionality: [#152](https://github.com/Rotonde/rotonde-client/pull/152)
- Images in clipboard can be uploaded by just pasting them into Rotonde: [#155](https://github.com/Rotonde/rotonde-client/pull/155)  
  And because it wasn't too hard, I've also added clipboard and saving support to Dotgrid (vector graphics editor), working OOTB with Rotonde: [#22](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Dotgrid/pull/22)
- And a dozen minor tweaks, bugfixes and improvements here and there.

(Psst! Rotonde's creator Devine Lu Linvega and Rekka Bellum are currently sailing around the world! Go [follow their adventures on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzdg4pZb-viC3EdA1zxRl4A/videos) and [support them on Patreon!](https://www.patreon.com/100))

Working on Rotonde is fun and refreshing (and I'll keep contributing in smaller quantities in the future)! It kept me productive and away from the frustrations I'd otherwise be dealing with in MonoMod...

As you may or may not know, MonoMod is the "dirty meat," the core of XnaToFna. It deals with the actual relinking pass and since recently, it deals with hooking FNA at "patch-time" to process the game's content and at runtime when the game's using it to decompress the processed content.

It achieves this using the [MonoMod.Detour.RuntimeDetour class](https://github.com/0x0ade/MonoMod/blob/master/MonoMod/Detour/RuntimeDetour.cs), which doesn't operate on IL-level like the rest of MonoMod. Instead, it operates with the JITed method code on the native level - it's more similar to other native detourers than to a .NET-specific solution.  
The only .NET-specific part about it is how it's getting the method's starting address, which can get messy. The rest of it is a lot of sugar to keep it easy to use and some trampoline management code, allowing hooks to call the last hook or even the original.

It's not a horrible mess, but it's still messy: I'm dealing with native code in a managed language, with all the drawbacks of both. I can't just, let's say, hook up Valgrind to see what could go wrong, but the Visual Studio debugger doesn't give me enough information, either. Using x64dbg is only possible with a workaround as it can't start .NET Framework applications and even then, good luck reverse engineering your own code.

I was fine with that. Until now.  
MonoMod.Detour.RuntimeDetour is causing issues with the .NET Framework, maybe memory corruption, possibly something else.

That's not your usual exception. That's a FatalExecutionEngineError, complaining how [Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content.ExternalReferenceReader.Read](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA/blob/c0a2dbc6bc959b44edd1b5ab4e27dc9a317ea416/src/Content/ContentReaders/ExternalReferenceReader.cs#L27) causes an ["AccessViolation in clr.dll"](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/en-US/dd3be208-c46c-4a5d-94ce-f93766c9d122/help-error-code-0xc0000005faulting-module-path?forum=clr#8d195916-f669-4d05-aa85-e21cc1e0b841) - even though XnaToFna doesn't hook it at all!

Even worse: It occurs no matter what I hook. If I just hook any single method, this method suddenly "dies." And it's always [Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content.ExternalReferenceReader.Read](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA/blob/c0a2dbc6bc959b44edd1b5ab4e27dc9a317ea416/src/Content/ContentReaders/ExternalReferenceReader.cs#L27), nothing else. I can't make sense of that and after having spent too much time trying to fix the issue, I'm labeling this as a "roadblock" I need to work around.

I'd just prefer to mark RuntimeDetour as deprecated and call it a day, but on the other hand, it works better than expected in Unity games... which are using an outdated fork of Mono... oh, the irony. MonoMod aiming to be a cross-platform, cross-framework solution, but only working with mono.

I mean, look at this. Zatherz is able to detour an Unity game's functions at runtime using Lua / Eluant and MonoMod's RuntimeDetour.

Let that sink in for a moment.

If you're reading this and depending on RuntimeDetour, I advise you to give [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) a try. It was previously limited to Mono, but I've contributed my .NET Framework - related detouring code to it. The only Windows-related issue at the moment is an AccessViolation related to  the memory protection level before writing to the method's code (different from my issue). A pull request / patchset containing a fix has been worked on by hcoona, though: [#28](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony/pull/28)

So, what are my plans for XnaToFna, now that I deem RuntimeDetour as "too unstable?" It's so simple, I'm wondering why I just didn't do this in the first place:
- At the moment, both "offline" (patch-time) and "online" (game runtime) hooks share the same codebase. They'll be split.
- The "offline" hooks will instead become an IL-level patch, applied with MonoMod to FNA.dll in memory before loading it to the AppDomain.
- The "online" hooks will instead be relocated to a "man-in-the-middle" class, similar to how the XnaToFnaGame and XnaToFnaSerializationBinderWrapper classes function at the moment.

I'll be away during the weekend; work on that will begin as soon as I'm back home. I've at least got some good news before leaving for the weekend, though:

[![Screenshot of HollowKnight.Modding readme mentioning MonoMod]({{ media }}/hollow-knight-monomod.png)](https://github.com/seanpr96/HollowKnight.Modding)

The Hollow Knight Modding API is moving from manually patching the .dll to automatically patching it with MonoMod! I'm more than excited to support them with their efforts and I'm also happy to listen to their feedback and to accept their pull requests. "iamwyza" has already helped in fixing issues that I saw as "non-critical," which were actual show stoppers for them.

For example, I've noticed that MonoMod can produce .dlls referring to multiple versions of mscorlib (the .NET Framework core library) at once. While it works just fine on my end, it turns out that it actually caused issues with Hollow Knight! And let's not talk about MonoMod completely forgetting about fixing / handling EventDefinitions.  
Luckily enough, Jonathon Wyza was ready to test my changes and provide fixes. Again, thank you!

[The only thing left is "injection" support](https://github.com/0x0ade/MonoMod/issues/15) - the ability to either replace or extend parts of an already existing method's IL body. While I'm not really a fan of injection (code flow issues ahoy!), I've evaluated the situation with the team and came to the conclusion that injection really is the only feasible option. In the meantime until that's a thing in MonoMod, I've provided them with an example on how to use MonoModRules + MonoModCustomMethodAttribute + Mono.Cecil to mark methods and execute custom processors on them at patch-time.  
Again, thank you for helping me out with the fix-multicorlib branch and with fixing the EventDefinition issue!

This wouldn't be possible without your support on Patreon. Thank you so much! Luckily I haven't had as many financial issues this month as last month, which allowed me to spend more time in front of my screen and keyboard. Hopefully this can continue on until and beyond next year!
