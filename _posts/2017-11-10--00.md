The good news: XnaToFna can now unpack XEX2 files, thanks to [rexdex's work in the "recompiler" project.](https://github.com/rexdex/recompiler) As far as I know, it contains the only MIT-licensed copy of the X360 keys required to do this... from a Russian forum, posted by someone who found it somewhere. But it works!

The bad news:

<!-- MORE -->

I'm currently experiencing random memory corruption issues with the MonoMod runtime detourer, which powers the XnaToFna FNA content hooks. Those are required to make the "XNB transformer" functional.

Unfortunately I'm still trying to find a fix for this. I can't just use valgrind on Windows on a .NET Framework application, but everything seems "fine" on my end. In the worst case, it's an actual .NET Framework JIT bug.. or related to it? I don't know anymore.

If I won't be able to fix this issue by next week, I'll replace the runtime hooking mechanism with "patching FNA before we load it into our AppDomain." I personally prefer modifying IL before load over patching JITed native code anyway, but I really want to fix this as it also affects other projects!

In the meantime, whenever I feel "exhausted" from the MonoMod issue, I'm contributing to rotonde, a great P2P social network. Think "self-hosted torrent-based Twitter", except it's not based on torrents, but the "dat" protocol. You can see my contributions to the project [here.](https://github.com/Rotonde/rotonde-client/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=author%3A0x0ade%20) Basically, I've already contributed a few fixes, pagination support, inline images (f.e. "emojis") and a "discovery" tab. If you've already got rotonde, add my portal: [dat://rotonde-0x0ade.hashbase.io](dat://rotonde-0x0ade.hashbase.io)
