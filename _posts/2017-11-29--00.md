<!-- MORE -->

- Got XnaToFna away from RuntimeDetour
- Set up a horrible roundabout way of moving FNA.dll out of the runtime's way, so that we forcibly load our patched-in-memory copy in a separate AppDomain
- Set up a helper ContentManager which only returns the stream I want it to return
- Got many [frustrating](https://twitter.com/0x0ade/status/935976909170765824), [hilarious](https://twitter.com/0x0ade/status/935990734729154560), weird results (see screenshot above)
- Game still doesn't run because it accesses .NET Compact Framework / 2.0 private field via reflection, but XnaToFna retargets game to .NET Framework 4.0
- Two upcoming exams and I don't feel prepared enough
