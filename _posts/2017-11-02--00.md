This update post is just a mini update post.

<!-- MORE -->

- All of Iced Lizard Games' XNA 4.0 games should be working.
- "Amazing Princess Sarah" seems to be functional, didn't finish the game though.
- Runtime environment variable `XNATOFNA_DISPLAY_SIZE=WxH` forces the game to run in a given resolution, fitting "Amazing Princess Sarah" on non-1080p screens.
- XNB content transformer issue on Mono / Linux fixed. Mono failed resolving types without telling it where to look.
- XnaToFna GZIPs all content by default. Before, XnaToFna extracted all content, resulting in UnderRail having a 20 GB large "locales" folder.
- (Not in the lastest XnaToFna release, but on GitHub:)  
  The sound effect clicking noise has been fixed. I forgot that C# auto-casted the `length` value to long (8 bytes), when the `length` field is only an int (4 bytes).

This week was quite "boring," but that's what I expected - as time goes on, "milestones" will be sparser and harder to hit.

Amazing Princess Sarah contains custom effects (shaders + extra data), but doesn't use them (it didn't use them in my playthrough). Once I get my hands on a game using non-default effects, I can finally begin making MojoShader deal with X360 effect binaries.

In the meantime, grab yourself a copy of [FNA 17.11](https://plus.google.com/+flibitijibibo/posts/QTsowrdjh8c), [XnaToFna](https://github.com/0x0ade/XnaToFna) and test it with any X360 game using XNA 4.0 you can get your hands on! Maybe you've got a game using effects lying around...

Semi-related: [MonoMod's runtime detourer now has got a "refresh" method](https://github.com/0x0ade/MonoMod/commit/2ae889c85956ca11730b91f8e9481d0e69e82763) as the .NET Framework JIT likes to revert changes under some circumstances. This is another case where working on XnaToFna helps MonoMod, which in turn helps other future game mods.
